REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Summary

> I have created a music quiz program. There has been some issues along the way, but I have been able to solve (most) them, so the program should work as expected, although I have been having some problems with the local storage on the deployment site, I did however not have these problems with my local files. 
I feel that I have learned alot from this project, as I didn't have previous experience with JavaScript before this course. In the later stages of developing this program I started to see how I would be able to make the code more efficient. I didn't really change alot of the things that I learned because, mainly, it worked as it was, and that I can look back and see both methods, one example of this is when I change the colors of the boxes I use different functions to target both the buttons and the colors, but when I wanted to add some yellow effects upon winning I created one function with both the colors and targetting the buttons.     

# User Guide

> There are 10 different levels, each level has different questions, and they will be chosen by random. There are a hint button and a 50/50 button, the hint will provide a hint for the question, and the 50/50 button will remove two of the wrong options. These can only be used once (you can use both once) each game, then they will be disabled. After you have finished playing, you can see your statistics under the 'Session Statistics' page on the home screen.
