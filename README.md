REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

> You can see my notes under the bug-list and the time-report.

# Project Summary

> I have created a music quiz program. There has been some issues along the way, but I have been able to solve them, so the program should work as expected. 

# User Guide

> There are 10 different levels, each level has different questions, and they will be chosen by random. There are a hint button and a 50/50 button, the hint will provide a hint for the question, and the 50/50 button will remove two of the wrong options. These can only be used once (you can use both once) each game, then they will be disabled. After you have finished playing, you can see your statistics under the 'Session Statistics' page on the home screen.
