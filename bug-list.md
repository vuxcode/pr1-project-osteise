1. *SOLVED* How can I output the correct answer in the submit box when the answer is incorrect..
2. How do I prevent the user from refreshing (on any question) to get a new question?
3. Can I create a .js that is shared with all the question pages? So that I can update variables depending on how many questions the user guesses correct on.
